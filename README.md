# CafeCosmos DotNet

The VisionContracts solution is the CafeCosmos core logic for the Unity3D interface of the game which is also reused in the CafeCosmos Blazor implementation, this can also be used to understand the internal mechanics of the game and create your own automations if wanted.

The heart of the solution is the VisionContracts project, which has the essential services, models, and contracts necessary to interact with and manipulate the game state. Several auxiliary projects expand the functionality, including REST APIs, data normalization services, and database processing components to extract / index the data from the smart contracts into a database. 

If you are interested on how to interact with the project, a good starting point is the [CafeCosmos automation example](CafeCosmos.AutomationExample/Readme.md).
